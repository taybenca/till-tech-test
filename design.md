# The problem

We want to sell tills to a local hipster coffee shop who are finally embracing the 21st century. 
We need a new till to replace their vintage machines - 
unfortunately, hipster staff are too cool to learn a new system, 
so we need you to build something that they will understand.

# Functions

constructor => items = []
addItem

calculateTheTaxes
printTheBill

# Tests

addItem("Tea") => return "Tea"
addItem("Americano") => return "Americano"
listItems = return array with all items
calculateTheTaxes => 8.63% * totalItems
printTheBill
